## 📊 DR Detection Workflow  

1. **Input**: Retinal fundus image  
2. **Preprocessing**: CLAHE enhancement + grayscale  
3. **Feature Extraction**:  
   - Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)  
   - Local Binary Patterns (LBP)  
   - Image entropy  
   - Vessel density  
4. **Classification**: XGBoost model → predicts **No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Proliferative**  
5. **Output**: Predicted stage + confidence score

## 🍽️ Nutrition Recommendation Workflow  

1. **Input**: Restaurant menu (image/text/web-scraped)  
2. **Processing**: NLP-based dish name matching with nutrition database  
3. **Analysis**: Evaluates calories, carbs, sugars, sodium, etc.  
4. **Output**: Safe vs unsafe dishes with personalized recommendations based on DR stage
